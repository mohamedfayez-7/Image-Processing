Instructions:
1) Enhance the given image 𝑔(𝑥, 𝑦) using the suitable operation(s) to get an 
enhanced version 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦).
2) Get the frequency domain representation 𝐹(𝑢, 𝑣) of 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦) using Fourier 
Transform
3) What is the DC value of 𝐹(𝑢, 𝑣)?
4) Select the necessary five frequency domain features as the image’s 
signature vector.
5) Obtain the signature vector for each image in each class.
6) Classify the testing image to belong to one of the five previously mentioned 
classes.
